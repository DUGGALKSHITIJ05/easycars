                <h2 class="text">Open innovation is nothing new. Innovations have always openly been achieved despite boundaries and across organizations. As we all know that students and young adults move out of their homes for education and jobs so it becomes very difficult for them to travel or cutting their expenses in travelling because cabs are expensive everywhere. And buying their own personal vehicle at initial stage of their move out is difficult. So we came up with an idea of renting cars/ two wheeler according to their needs for short road trip or a week long trip with friends & family you can rent a car according to you budget and convince and drive it your own. With easy access of pick and drop of vehicles</h2>
